This project contains the code that will be generated once choosing the "advanced sample project that uses TypeScript" while running 'npx hardhat'

WARNING:

-> Works with Hardhat 2.9.9, so consider downgrading your hardhat installation

-> Ropsten is deprecated now but Alchemy has options to create a similar url on the Goerli network. Follow these steps: https://www.alchemy.com/ and choose 'get started for free'. Follow the steps they ask.



NOTES:
-> I do not work for the METIS foundation, and this work is non commercial and only a demo

-> The contract is generated by hardhat and only used as an example

-> The text documentation on this is available on : https://docs.metis.io/dev/get-started/deploying-on-metis
